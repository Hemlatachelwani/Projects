## This repository contains different data structure and algorithm types in python. Some of the examples below are:

- Binary Search (for numbers)

- Binary Search (for strings)

- Bogo Sort

- Counting Sort

- Linear search (for numbers)

- Linear search (for strings)

- Linked List

- Linked List (Merge Sort)

- Merge Sort

- Bubble Sort

- Heap Sort

- Insertion Sort  

- Quick Sort (for numbers)

- Quick Sort (for strings)

- Radix Sort

- Recursion

- Recursive Binary Search

- Selection Sort

- Binary Tree traversal

- Radix Sort (for numbers) using Counting Sort
1. Find the largest number int given array. It has n digits. Therefore, the loop should go up to hundreds place (n times)
2. It is stable sorting algorithm
3. Sort the elements based on the unit place digits, then tenth place digits ... nTh place digits
